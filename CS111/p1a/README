The files that are included in my submission are as follows:

lab1a.c: the source file of my program, including the main funciton. 
The program is capable of accepting a command line argument --shell 
and lauch two processes so as to be able to run shell commands while 
accepting user input. 

Makefile: script automating the building of the lab1a executable and 
the packaging of project files

README: this file. Contains a description of the files included in 
the tarball as well as some general informaiton relating to my 
submission.

Design Decision:

I made a design decision to stop echoing stdin after my program, invoked
with --shell option, encounters a ^D, because the characters which follow
will not be sent to the shell. So it would misinform the user if they
are echoed back to the terminal. Rather, if the user types really fast and
the system runs very slowly, it would appear that the characters entered
after ^D had no effect. This approach effectively effectively eliminates
the need for a sigpipe handler. however, one is still included in the 
program for robustness. 

Research:

While implementing this program, I extensively consulted the man pages of
related functions for calling interface as well as usage examples. I also 
came across a good introduction to the use of termios on wikibooks:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming/termios
as well as a tutorial on poll by IBM:
