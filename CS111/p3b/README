Description of files

lab3b.py: The python program which is my solution to the assignment. This script performs certain integrity audits on a CSV file which represents data on a (possibly corrupted) hard disk. My program is capable of detecting various inconsistencies and report it to the user. 

Makefile: Script for use with the make utility to automate standard build targets: default, clean, and dist. Since python programs are interprepted, the default targets does not produce an executable. Instead, it creates a soft link named lab3b to my script, per assignment specification.

README: This file provides a description of my other project files.
