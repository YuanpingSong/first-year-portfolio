my_beaglebone.jpg: A picture of me smilingly holding my beaglebone. 

build_run.png: A picture showing an ssh session over the wifi to my beaglebone in which I, as the root user, compiled and executed a trivial c program I previously uploaded to the device. 

connected.png: A picture of an ssh session over the USB. I ran the hostname command to show that I correctly changed the hostname of my beaglebone to xxxxxxxxx.lasr.cs.ucla.edu, and then ran the ifconfig command to show that my beaglebone is connected to internet over WIFI.

copy.png: A picture showing a command line session from my laptop in which I transfered a trivial c program to the beaglebone using scp.
