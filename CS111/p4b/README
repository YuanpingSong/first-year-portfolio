Comments
There is a hardware problem with my board. The GPIO Port 50 seems broken. I wasn't able to initialize
my button when it is connected to this port. However, GPIO Port 51 worked so during development,
I used 62 as the initialization constant in the call to mraa_gpio_init(). I changed the call back
to mraa_gpio_init(60) in this submission in order to conform with the spec. However, I would like to
point out that this was not tested and that if any errors arise as the result of this change, I would like
to request an oppurtunity to revert my code to a functioning version.
