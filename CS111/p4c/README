Description:
The included files are:
lab4c_tcp.c: A networked IoT program which collects temperature information
while interacting with a server using TCP.
lab4c_tls.c: The same program but networking is done using the OpenSSL library and TLS for added security.
Makefile: A script for the make utility which automatically builds executables conforming to the specification. It also
packages the files in this assignment into a tarball. Supports default build targets: default, clean, and dist.
README: this file. Contains a description of the files included in the tarball as well as some general informaiton relating
to mysubmission.

Research:
In order to complete the tls portion of the assignment, I consulted the OpenSSL Library Documentation:
https://www.openssl.org/docs/
I also learned the general approach of using OpenSSL for TLS from a tutorial published by IBM Developerworks:
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-openssl/index.html
