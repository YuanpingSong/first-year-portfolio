A.
In writing this program, several notable obstacles which I overcame include file input, program logic, c-string manipulation, and user interaction. I resolved each difficulty through a combination of reasoning as well as trial-and-error.

B. 
The design of my program is as follows:

runOneRound: 

check for bad arguments
find secret word
repeatedly:
	prompt reader for probe word
	if probe word is legal
		proceed
	else 
		inform the user
		continue
	if probe word equals secret word
		break
	determine the number of stars and planets
	output the number of stars and planets
return the number of rounds

Main: 

load words into array and store the number of words
if no word is loaded 
	inform the user
	terminate
if the words can fit in the array
	prompt reader for the number of rounds
	check if number is positive
	repeatedly:
		output round number
		randomly select secret word
		output length of secret word
		play one round and record score
		inform the reader how many tires he/she took
		output stats
else
	inform the user of an error
