The purpose of this lab is to use Beaglebone Green Wireless Development
Board as a linux server, and to practice on it the ssh protocol. 

There are a few extra setup steps involved for this lab because I am 
using a pre-owned beaglebone. I followed the instructions posted on
the company's website to flash the on-board storage. So I downloaded
the lastest debian image for the board, burned it into a micro SD card, 
then used the card to write into the board's flash memory. This process
took around ten minutes. Afterwards, I just rebooted the beaglebone and
it is ready to connect via wifi. 

My lab partner is Alex Zhao
