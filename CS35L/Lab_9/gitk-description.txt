The three connected windows on top displays information regarding the
version history of the repository. Specifically, the subwindow on the 
right diagrams the history of commits and merges, together with short
commit messages, to give users an overall idea and to help them orient
themselves. The middle pane shows the contact information of the author
of each commit. The rightmost window shows the date when the commit is 
out. Below are numbers that such as the hash of the commit and the total
number of commits in the project. 

The bottom right subwindow demonstrates text information of the actual 
effect of each commit. It displays changes in the diff format, with 
helpful highlights. To the right is a large pane which serves to inform
the user regarding the structure of the patch file.
