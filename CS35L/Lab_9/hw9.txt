8. My lab partner is Alex Zhao, and I received a patch from him
$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
$ git am formatted-patch_alex.txt
Applying: 2018-06-08 Alex Zhao <alexz@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu>

build: 
$ ./bootstrap 
$ wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring18/cs35L/assign/
diffutils-gets.diff
$ patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

The last command gives an error: 
/bin/sh: /bin/sh: cannot execute binary file
however, /bin/sh is not something that we modified in this lab.
furthermore, When I performed basic tests such as ./src/diff . -
the output: ./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory. So I 
conclude that my partner's patch functions correctly. 

9. 
$ make distdir
$ cd diffutils-3.0.1-e2b5
$ emacs ChangeLog

I see that the top entry in the change log is written by Alex: 

2018-06-08  Alex Zhao  <alexz@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu>

                maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

                This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
                which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
                `like this' or ``like this''.
