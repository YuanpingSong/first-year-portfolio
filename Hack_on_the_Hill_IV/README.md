Shout out to ACM-Hack for hosting such an amazing event! This is my first Hackathon experience. I teamed up with Alex Zhao, Samuel Lee, and Henry Nguyen. We started out with a vision for an app that would replace the swipe-swap facebook group as the main forum where bruins trade swipes. That turns out to be too complex for a hackathon project. But luckily we discovered Alexa! Creative integration with hardware helped us stand out from the crowd and won us an award.
